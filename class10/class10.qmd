# The PBD Database

First let's see what is in the PDB database - the main repository of protein structures. 

Downloaded composition stats from: https://tiny.url.com/statspdb

For context: Release 2023_04 of 13-Sep-2023 of UniProtKB/TrEMBL contains 251,600,768 sequence entries. The PDB only contains 183,201

```{r}
stats <- read.csv("PDBstats.csv", row.names=1)
stats
```

There is a problem here due to the commas in the numbers. This causes R to treat them as characters.

```{r}
x <- stats$X.ray
x
```

```{r}
as.numeric(gsub(",", "", x))
```

I can write a function using `gsub()` and `as.numeric()` to apply it.
```{r}
rm.comma <- function(x) {
  as.numeric(gsub(",", "", x))
}
```

```{r}
rm.comma(stats$EM)
```

I can use `apply()` to fix the whole table...
```{r}
pdbstats <- apply(stats, 2, rm.comma)
rownames(pdbstats) <- rownames(stats)
head(pdbstats)
```

> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}
totals <- apply(pdbstats, 2, sum)
round(totals/totals["Total"] * 100, 2)
```

> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
round(pdbstats[1, "Total"] / sum(pdbstats[,"Total"]) * 100, 2)
```

> Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

*SKIPPED for time*

## Visualizing the HIV-1 protease structure

> Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?

*The resolution of the image is only 2Å, and hydrogen is smaller than this, and so is not visible at this resolution. That is why we only see the oxygen.*

> Q5: There is a critical “conserved” water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have?

*This is water HOH 308. It is identified on figure 1 below.*

> Q6: Generate and save a figure clearly showing the two distinct chains of HIV-protease along with the ligand. You might also consider showing the catalytic residues ASP 25 in each chain and the critical water (we recommend “Ball & Stick” for these side-chains). Add this figure to your Quarto document.

Here us a lovely figure of HIP-Pr with the catalytic ASP residues, the MK1 compound and the all important water 308

## The bio3d package for structural bioinformatics

```{r}
library(bio3d)

pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```

```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

# Predicting functional motions of a single structure

Let's finish today with a bioinformatics calculation to predict the functional motions of a PDB structure.

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
m <- nma(adk)
```

```{r}
plot(m)
mktrj(m, file="adk_m7.pdb")
```
