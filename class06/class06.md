# All about functions in R

Functions are the way we get stuff done in R. We call a function to read
data, compute stuff, plot stuff, etc.

R makes writing functions accessible but we should always start by
trying to get a working snippet of code first before we write our
function.

## Today’s Lab

We will grade a whole class of student assignments. We will always try
to start with a simplified version of the new problem.

``` r
# Example input vectors to start with
student1 <- c(100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 90)
student2 <- c(100, NA, 90, 90, 90, 90, 97, 80)
student3 <- c(90, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA)
```

If we want the average we can use the `mean()` function

``` r
mean(student1)
```

    [1] 98.75

Let’s be nice instructors and drop the lowest score so the answer here
should be 100.

I can use the `min()` function to find the lowest value.

``` r
min(student1)
```

    [1] 90

I found the `which.min()` function that may be useful here. How does it
work? Let’s just try it:

``` r
student1
```

    [1] 100 100 100 100 100 100 100  90

``` r
which.min(student1)
```

    [1] 8

I can use the minus syntax trick to get everything but the element with
the min value.

``` r
student1[-which.min(student1)]
```

    [1] 100 100 100 100 100 100 100

I have my first working snippet of code :-)

``` r
mean(student1[-which.min(student1)])
```

    [1] 100

Let’s test on the other students

``` r
student2
```

    [1] 100  NA  90  90  90  90  97  80

``` r
mean(student2[-which.min(student2)])
```

    [1] NA

Where is the problem - oh it is the `mean()` with NA input returns NA
without including syntax `na.rm()` in the `mean()` argument.

``` r
mean(student2, na.rm = TRUE)
```

    [1] 91

Lets test on student 3

``` r
mean(student3, na.rm=TRUE)
```

    [1] 90

No bueno. We need to fix this!

I want to stop working with `student1`, `student2`, `student3` etc. and
typing it out everytime so lets instead work with an input called `x`.

``` r
x <- student2
x
```

    [1] 100  NA  90  90  90  90  97  80

We want to overwrite the NA values with zero - if you miss a homework
you score zero on this homework.

Google and Claude told me about the `is.na` function. Lets see how it
works.

``` r
x
```

    [1] 100  NA  90  90  90  90  97  80

``` r
is.na(x)
```

    [1] FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE

``` r
x[is.na(x)] <- 0
x
```

    [1] 100   0  90  90  90  90  97  80

We can use logicals to index a vector.

``` r
y <- 1:5
y
```

    [1] 1 2 3 4 5

``` r
y > 3
```

    [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE

``` r
y[y > 3]
```

    [1] 4 5

``` r
y[y >3] <- 100
```

This is my working snippet of code that solves the problem for all of my
example inputs :-)

``` r
x <-  student3
# Mask NA values to zero
x[is.na(x)] <- 0
#Drop lowest score and get mean
mean(x[-which.min(x)])
```

``` r
grade <- function(x) {
  # Mask NA values to zero
  x[is.na(x)] <- 0
  #Drop lowest score and get mean
  mean(x[-which.min(x)])
}
```

Use this function:

``` r
grade(student1)
```

    [1] 100

``` r
grade(student2)
```

    [1] 91

``` r
grade(student3)
```

    [1] 12.85714

We need to read the gradebook. We use `row.names()` in order to make the
students the primary column.

``` r
gradebook <- read.csv("https://tinyurl.com/gradeinput",
                      row.names=1)
gradebook
```

               hw1 hw2 hw3 hw4 hw5
    student-1  100  73 100  88  79
    student-2   85  64  78  89  78
    student-3   83  69  77 100  77
    student-4   88  NA  73 100  76
    student-5   88 100  75  86  79
    student-6   89  78 100  89  77
    student-7   89 100  74  87 100
    student-8   89 100  76  86 100
    student-9   86 100  77  88  77
    student-10  89  72  79  NA  76
    student-11  82  66  78  84 100
    student-12 100  70  75  92 100
    student-13  89 100  76 100  80
    student-14  85 100  77  89  76
    student-15  85  65  76  89  NA
    student-16  92 100  74  89  77
    student-17  88  63 100  86  78
    student-18  91  NA 100  87 100
    student-19  91  68  75  86  79
    student-20  91  68  76  88  76

I can use the `apply` function if I figure out how to use it:

``` r
ans <- apply(gradebook, 1, grade)
ans
```

     student-1  student-2  student-3  student-4  student-5  student-6  student-7 
         91.75      82.50      84.25      84.25      88.25      89.00      94.00 
     student-8  student-9 student-10 student-11 student-12 student-13 student-14 
         93.75      87.75      79.00      86.00      91.75      92.25      87.75 
    student-15 student-16 student-17 student-18 student-19 student-20 
         78.75      89.50      88.00      94.50      82.75      82.75

```

    student-18 
            18

We could calculate the `mean()` score for each homework.

``` r
mask <- gradebook
mask[is.na(mask)] <- 0
hw.ave <- apply(mask, 2, mean)
hw.ave
```

      hw1   hw2   hw3   hw4   hw5 
    89.00 72.80 80.80 85.15 79.25 

``` r
which.min(hw.ave)
```

    hw2 
      2 

We could take the `sum()`.

``` r
hw.sum <- apply(gradebook, 2, sum, na.rm=T)
which.min(hw.sum)
```

    hw2 
      2 

> Q4. Optional Extension: From your analysis of the gradebook, which
> homework was most predictive of overall score (i.e. highest
> correlation with average grade score)? \[1pt\]

``` r
apply(mask, 2, cor, y=ans)
```

          hw1       hw2       hw3       hw4       hw5 
    0.4250204 0.1767780 0.3042561 0.3810884 0.6325982 

``` r
which.max(apply(mask, 2, cor, y=ans))
```

    hw5 
      5
